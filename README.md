In modern production systems, the ability to flexibly adapt to new circumstances and facilitate robust production is a key feature to be competitive. One possibility that assists in cope with modern production challenges is the use of a state-of-the-art modular production layout and AI optimization methods. 
This is were CoBra will help, combining open access solutions to leverage production performances.

Thereby, modular production has several advantages including:
1. Flexibility: Modules can be easily added, removed, or replaced, which allows for quick adjustments andto adapt to changing market demands.
2. Cost-effectiveness: Modular production can lead to cost savings due to economies of scale and the ability to reuse components.
3. Efficiency: Modules can be pre-fabricated and then assembled on-site, which can speed up the construction process and reduce labor costs.
4. Sustainability: Modular construction can be more environmentally friendly because it generates less waste and can utilize sustainable materials.

In such a system, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has several advantages when applied to production control, including:
1. Optimization: RL algorithms can be used to optimize processes by learning to make decisions that maximize a specific performance metric
2. Adaptability: RL algorithms can adapt to changing conditions in the production environment, such as variations in raw materials or equipment failures.
3. Autonomy: RL-controlled production systems can operate autonomously, reducing the need for human intervention and improving overall efficiency.
4. Scalability: RL algorithms can be scaled to control large and complex production systems.
