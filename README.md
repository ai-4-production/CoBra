In modern production systems, the ability to flexibly adapt to new circumstances and facilitate robust production is a key feature to be competitive. One possibility that assists in cope with modern production challenges is the use of a state-of-the-art modular production layout and AI optimization methods. 

Thereby, modular production has several advantages including:
1. Flexibility: Modules can be easily added, removed, or replaced, which allows for quick adjustments to the production process and the ability to adapt to changing market demands.
2. Cost-effectiveness: Modular production can lead to cost savings due to economies of scale and the ability to reuse components.
3. Efficiency: Modules can be pre-fabricated and then assembled on-site, which can speed up the construction process and reduce labor costs.
4. Quality control: Modules can be tested and inspected before they are assembled, which can improve the overall quality of the final product.
5. Sustainability: Modular construction can be more environmentally friendly because it generates less waste and can utilize sustainable materials.
